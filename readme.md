Privacy Policy
Highlight Prices

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how the "Highlight Prices" extension handles your information and data.

Information Collection and Use
The "Highlight Prices" extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information or data. The extension operates entirely within your browser and does not communicate with any external servers or databases.

Permissions
The extension requires certain permissions to function correctly:

ActiveTab: This permission allows the extension to access the currently active tab when you click on the extension's icon. It is necessary for the extension to highlight prices on the page you are currently viewing.
Scripting: This permission is required to inject the necessary scripts to highlight price information on the web pages you visit.
These permissions are solely used to provide the intended functionality of the extension and are not used to collect any personal information.

How the Extension Works
The extension uses a script to scan the content of the web pages you visit for price information. When it detects price information, it highlights it to make it more visible. This process is done entirely within your browser and does not involve sending any data outside of your browser.

No Data Collection
We want to assure you that:

No personal information: The extension does not collect any personal information such as your name, email address, or browsing history.
No data storage: The extension does not store any information on your device or on external servers.
No tracking: The extension does not track your browsing activities.
Third-Party Services
